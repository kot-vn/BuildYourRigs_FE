              IF YOU'VE BEEN beating yourself up about doing nothing productive
              during our never-ending pandemic, stop. Sometimes doing nothing is
              exactly what you need. Other times, it’s nice to make something
              with your own hands. That’s what this guide is about: how to build
              a PC from scratch.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              It can be daunting for a lot of reasons—it’s expensive, it’s
              complex, it can get messy. But I want to be clear: If you can
              build an Ikea table, bookshelf, bed, or anything that comes in
              more than one of those deceivingly heavy flat packs, you can build
              a PC. The tricky part? I can't tell you how to build your PC. Not
              really. Not unless I know exactly which hardware you're using. I
              can, however, explain what each component does and what my
              recommendations are for each category.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Once you’ve built your shiny new PC, it might be time to check out
              some other stuff to further accessorize your new partner in crime.
              Be sure to have a look at our guides for the best gaming

            <h2>First, Let’s Talk Shortages</h2>
            <br />
            <p>For several years now we've been in the midst of a PC hardware shortage. First,
              cryptocurrency miners bought up all the GPUs to farm crypto, then we got hit by a worldwide
              silicon shortage, and then there was that whole pandemic thing. Point is, it's tough to get
              all the parts you need to build a PC, it has been for years, and it's likely to continue
              being tough for the foreseeable future. I can't fix a global logistics crisis, but I can
              give you some pointers on shopping during one.</p>
            <br>
            <hr />
            <br>
            <h2>Third-Party Markup</h2>
            <br>
            <p>When you're shopping for components, make sure you're buying from a reputable vendor. You may
              think you're buying from a large online store like Amazon, Walmart, or Newegg, but they
              allow third-party sellers to list products as well. There's usually a little notice that
              will tell you as much, right underneath the buy button. </p>
            <br>
            <p>If it's shipped and sold from someone who isn't Amazon, Walmart, or Newegg, you're probably
              going to pay more for the component than its retail price. For instance, our top motherboard
              pick retails for $130, but as of this writing its listed on Newegg for $205. It's shipped
              and sold from a third-party retailer, hence the markup. First-party sales (when the product
              is shipped and sold by the store whose site you're visiting) tend to have better prices that
              hew closer to the actual manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP) of the item.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We've tried to stick to first-party sales, but sometimes components are just not available
              through anyone but a third party. In that case, my advice is don't spend more than 50
              percent over the MSRP on any of these components. Give yourself a hard budget and please
              don't pay double or triple what any of these components are worth.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We've added buying advice to each category most affected by the shortage to speak more
              specifically to each component's scarcity, but in general just know that building a PC right
              now is probably going to cost you more than you'd expect.</p>

            <h2>What Do You Need?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>In order to get a list of components together, no matter what your experience level is, you
              should use PCPartPicker. Not only does it have everything you need to buy, it also lets you
              build your PC piece by piece right on the website and makes sure all your hardware will play
              nicely together. It even has a few example builds you can tweak to your liking.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Regardless of what kind of PC you’re building (home office or gaming), the components you
              need are going to be the same. You’ll need a motherboard, a central processing unit (CPU),
              storage, memory, a power supply, a case, and a monitor. The only thing you might not need if
              you're mostly using this PC for home-office tasks is a GPU (graphics processing unit), but
              it's necessary for photo or video editing and gaming. That’s a lot of stuff! Here's a little
              breakdown of what each component does, along with some hardware recommendations. </p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Every other component plugs into this circuit board. It’s the highway they use to communicate
              and collaborate. They come in different sizes and configurations, and each one looks a
              little different, but they all fill the same function. Make sure you know which processor
              you want before you buy a motherboard.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Motherboards come in a couple of flavors, but the most important thing to know is what kind
              of socket it has. There are basically two: LGA and AM. You'll always see them listed with a
              number after them, like “LGA1150” or “AM3.” The exact numbers after the LGA and AM portions
              of these socket names will change over time, to indicate which generation of Intel or AMD
              chips they support, but the current standards as of 2022 (which will work with the latest
              chips from either maker) are LGA1200 for Intel and AM4 for AMD.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Motherboards also come in a couple of sizes, the most common being ATX (or “full size”).
              That’s what I generally recommend, especially if this is your first build. Your PC case will
              list which size motherboard it supports, so make sure they match up.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <b>Buying advice: </b>
              Motherboards are less scarce than the other components on this list. We try
              to keep this list updated regularly with prices that aren't too much higher than MSRP, but
              if any of the prices here skyrockets between updates, shop around. Your chances of finding a
              reasonably priced motherboard are much better than your chances of finding a good price on a
              GPU.

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>This is the brain of your computer. It sockets directly into the motherboard, and it’s the
              single most important component of your PC. That doesn’t mean it has to be the most
              expensive (we’ll get to that later). If the CPU doesn't mention including thermal paste, get
              some. Don't eat your CPU. I know it looks tasty, but it's not actually food. </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <b>Buying advice: </b>
              You're going to see the highest markups on your CPU and GPU. But these prices
              will move around quite a bit, so keep checking back if you can't afford the component you
              want at the moment.

            <br>
            <p>If you’ll be playing games on this PC, you’ll need a graphics processing unit (also called a
              graphics card). This is a specialized processor that’s designed and optimized for handling
              visual data like the graphics in games. It's also used in video and photo editing and other
              graphics-intensive tasks. </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <b>Buying advice: </b>
              These cards are tough to find in stock (or at a reasonable price) at the moment, so you may
              have to wait a while. Graphics cards are among the most in-demand PC components right now,
              and their prices are way higher than they should be. That's why the picks on this list are
              generally mid- to high-end. If you're going to pay through the nose for a graphics card,
              make sure it's a good one.

            <br>
            <p>This is your PC’s walk-in closet. This is where you store all your files, your games, your
              movies, your documents, your photos, your everything. You can always add more storage later.

            <br>
            <p>You’ll see a lot of the same terms when you’re looking at memory and storage, but they’re
              very different. Memory is more like that one table you toss things on to deal with later.
              It’s scratch paper; it’s short-term. It’s very important, though, because software uses
              memory to cache (temporarily store) data in a place where it can be retrieved quickly.

            <p>Your power supply unit is a little box that keeps the electricity running to every component.
              It determines how quick and powerful your PC can be. The faster it is, the more power it
              needs, and you always want to have a little more than you need, just in case. Just like
              GPUs, PSUs are also in and out of stock right now.</p>

            <p>Your case is just what it sounds like. It’s a metal box. It might be covered in glass panels
              and etched aluminum, but inside it’s just a big metal box that holds everything together.
              Make sure you match it up with your motherboard size. For example, if you have an ATX
              motherboard, you need an ATX (or “full-size”) case.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The internal layout of every gaming PC is a little different, so we're not going to get too
              far into the weeds here. Your best bet for specific instructions for your hardware will be
              referencing your manuals and searching for your components on YouTube. It can be super
              helpful to actually see a person handle and install your exact hardware, especially when
              you're stuck and can't quite figure out what the hell your manual is talking about. But here
              are some general tips for putting all these components together.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>First, prep yourself a clean workspace. This can be a dining room table, a cleared-off
              desk—just any surface big enough for your case to lay flat on its side, with ample room
              around it for the rest of your components. You’ll also need a Phillips-head screwdriver that
              will fit the screws on your case. When you put these parts together, be sure to discharge
              any static buildup and work on a nonmetallic surface like a wooden table. Or you could just
              assemble the motherboard on top of the cardboard box it comes in.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Most of the components you bought are going to come with instruction manuals; keep them
              handy. We’re going to start with the motherboard, so open up the instruction manual to the
              installation page. It can be pretty intimidating—there’s a lot to look at—but think of all
              this as a big Lego set. Each piece fits into each other piece. For the motherboard, your
              first job is going to be seating your CPU.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Installing Your CPU</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Depending on what kind of CPU you purchased (Intel or AMD), the chip will have either little
              prongs on one side (don’t touch them) or little golden contacts on one side (don’t touch
              them). Seriously, don’t touch that side of your chip. Oils from your fingertips can damage
              the contacts, or you might bend a pin. Do either one and your processor becomes nothing more
              than an expensive hunk of silicon.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Seating your processor is pretty easy. First, double-check your motherboard’s instructions
              and make sure you’ve unlocked the processor socket. It’ll be a big square with a bunch of
              little holes (or contacts), with a lever or button beside it. Your motherboard’s
              instructions will say explicitly how to unlock the socket so you can put your processor in
              without any issues.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Once you’ve confirmed that it’s unlocked and ready, just find which corner of your processor
              has a little golden triangle and line it up with the same symbol on your motherboard’s
              processor socket. Gently lower the processor into the socket, then gently flip the latch or
              locking mechanism. You shouldn’t have to fight it. If you have to press really hard,
              double-check that the processor is socketed correctly.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Next, you’re going to need your thermal paste. That little tiny plastic syringe of silvery
              goo is very important for this next step. Now that your processor is seated, take a look at
              the shiny square of silicon in the center of it. That’s where your heat sink is going to
              sit. Your processor came with a heat sink, and on one side of it, you’ll see a copper
              circle. You’re going to be putting the heat sink directly on top of the processor after we
              apply the thermal paste, with the silicone square and the copper circle lining up perfectly.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Go ahead and carefully squeeze a tiny ball (no bigger than a pea) of thermal paste onto the
              silicon square on your processor. You’ll want it as close to the center as you can get.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Now line up your heat sink with the screws surrounding your processor, and gently lower it
              into place. You’re gonna squish the thermal paste, and the goal here is to create a thin
              layer covering the back of your processor. It’s OK if it oozes a little bit, but if it oozes
              out and over the edge of the processor, you used too much. Get some isopropyl alcohol, dab
              it on a lint-free wipe, and wipe the processor and heat sink. Wait till they’re thoroughly
              dry and try again.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If it looks all right, screw your heat sink into place. Flip back to your motherboard
              instruction book and find the right place near the processor socket to plug in your heat
              sink’s cooling fan. It should be very close to your processor socket. Once you’ve found it,
              plug it in—congratulations, you just installed a CPU. This was the hardest part, and it’s
              over. Good job!
            </p>

            <h3>Installing Your Storage and Memory</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Memory is maybe the easiest thing to install. See those vertical little sockets beside the
              CPU? Line up your sticks of RAM and slot them in, starting from the left-hand slot. They’ll
              lock into place once you’ve seated them properly. If you have two sticks of RAM, make sure
              to skip a slot between them. Your motherboard manual should say which slots to use.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For your hard drive or solid-state drive (SSD), find an empty bay in the front-facing part of
              your case. Slide your drive in and screw it into place. If you have an M.2 drive (a tiny SSD
              about the size of a stick of gum), there should be a place on the motherboard where you slot
              it in directly. Check out your motherboard’s manual to see where the M.2 slot is if you
              can't find it.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Installing Your Motherboard and Power Supply</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The rest of this is formulaic. Start by putting your motherboard into your case. Consult your
              motherboard’s instructions, line up the screw holes in the case with the ones on your
              motherboard, and get to work.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Next, you’ll want to install your power supply. There should be a spot for it near the top or
              bottom of the case, a big square spot that will fit your supply perfectly. If you’re having
              trouble finding it, look at the back of your case: There’ll be a big empty square. That’s
              where the power supply goes (and where you’ll plug in your PC when you’re all done). Once
              you've found its home, slot it in and screw it into place.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Make sure all the snaky cables coming out of the power supply will reach your motherboard
              with room to spare. Don’t plug in anything yet; we’re going to come back to the power supply
              in a bit.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Installing Your Graphics Card</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Your GPU is going to be pretty big. Even a modestly powerful GPU like the GTX 1060 is large
              compared to your other components. That means how it fits into your case is important. Once
              you put your GPU in there, space is going to start getting tight.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Flip open your motherboard’s instruction book again and look for a PCIe slot. It’s going to
              be a horizontal slot with a little plastic latch beside it, near the middle or bottom of
              your motherboard. That’s where the GPU plugs in. All you need to do is identify the back of
              your GPU (the side with the HDMI and DisplayPorts), line that up with the back of your case,
              and push the GPU into the horizontal slot. It should lock into place easily enough; if it
              doesn’t, make sure you’re inserting it correctly.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Find another one of those tiny little screws and fasten your GPU to the case. There’s a
              little spot for that on the same piece of metal with the HDMI ports. It should be easy to
              find.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Now, take a look at the cables coming out of your power supply. There should be a few that
              look like they could fit into the square (or rectangular) socket on the side of your GPU. It
              should look like six or eight little holes in a rectangle shape. If you’re having trouble,
              take a look at this video from hardware manufacturer Asus. Some of the specifics will be
              different, but it’s a great look at how to install a GPU.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Ribbon Cables</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The motherboard needs to be hooked into all your devices. The power supply unit I used in
              this build is what's called fully modular, which means that you can select the cables you
              need and leave the rest off to eliminate clutter. Otherwise, power supplies have a ton of
              cables, and you'll have to deal with the unused power connections dangling inside your case.
              You'll need to connect the PSU to the SSD and the motherboard.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You also need to plug the motherboard into your case—the power buttons, audio plugs, and USB
              ports on the front of your case. There are special headers for each kind of plug scattered
              around the board, so you'll want to check your manual for the location and function of each
              grouping of pins. These tiny pins need to be plugged in a certain way, and they're
              unbelievably minuscule. There's also a hookup for the case's fan—in the case I used there
              was one header on the motherboard but three fans installed. Then there's the SATA cable for
              your SSD, which plugs into the motherboard.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This part of your build really depends on the hardware you purchased, so consult the manuals
              for each component to ensure you've correctly plugged it into your motherboard and the power
              supply.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Boot It Up and Install Windows</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The final stage of your build is a simple one: Hit your power button. If the PC whirs to
              life, you probably put it together perfectly! If it doesn't, don't despair. There are a lot
              of potential problems that could cause a PC to fail to boot up for the first time. This
              video from Kingston goes over some pitfalls that might cause you some headaches, so if
              you're not able to boot your PC, give it a watch and retrace your steps.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
              There's also a chance you could have received faulty components. This video goes over some
              tips on how to check your parts. In general, if you’re having trouble with a specific
              component, YouTube is your friend. There are tons of helpful PC-building tutorials.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>If it started up just fine, the next step is super easy: Turn it off. Remember that Windows
              flash drive you made earlier? Plug it into the PC and boot it up again. If you set it up
              right, your computer should just do its thing and get started installing Windows. If not,
              you might need to open your BIOS (check your motherboard's manual for how to do that) and
              set the USB drive to be a “boot device” first. Here's a brief rundown of that process (start
              at step 3).</p>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <h1>You Did It!</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Congratulations on building your first PC. It's a bit of a pain, but it's a great way to
              spend an afternoon. Or a couple of days, depending on how many unforeseen headaches you run
              into. Seeing as the pandemic hasn’t totally gone away, you can use your new PC to help you
              spend all those extra indoor hours productively (or just grinding out loot in Warframe).</p>
